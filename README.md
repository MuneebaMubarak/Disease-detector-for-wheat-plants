#Deep Learning-based Smut and Rust detector for wheat plants

The proposed project aims to address the pressing issue of limited access to agricultural knowledge in rural Pakistan, specifically targeting wheat farmers facing the challenges of Rust and Smut diseases and to provide an accessible AI solution using Deep Learning models. This project helps early diagnosis for the diseased plants by providinng an easy accessible web interface that leads to minimize  yield loss.

##  Project Highlights
-  Disease Coverage: Rust (Brown, Stem, Stripe) & Smut (Loose, Flag)
-  Dataset: 10,000 images from 6 field visits in Sindh, Pakistan
-  Models Used: YOLOv8, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50
-  Interface: Built using Django + React
-  Impact: Supports food security, boosts farmer confidence

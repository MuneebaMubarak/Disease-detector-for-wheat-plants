The proposed project aims to address the pressing issue of limited access to agricultural knowledge in rural Pakistan, specifically targeting wheat farmers facing the challenges of Rust and Smut diseases and to provide an accessible AI solution using Deep Learning models. This project helps early diagnosis for the diseased plants by providinng an easy accessible web interface that leads to minimize  yield loss.

##  Project Highlights
-  Disease Coverage: Rust (Brown, Stem, Stripe) & Smut (Loose, Flag)
-  Dataset: 10,000 images from 6 field visits in Sindh, Pakistan
-  Models Used: YOLOv8, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50
-  Interface: Built using Django + React
-  Impact: Supports food security, boosts farmer confidence

## Folder Structure
Data Folder → Sample wheat images (Healthy, Rust, Smut)
Models Folder → YOLOv8, ResNet50, InceptionResNetV2 docs
Interface Folder → Screenshots of the web app
Results Folder → Model results and graphs
Notebooks Folder → Training notebooks

##  Models Used
- YOLOv8 (Finalized)
- InceptionResNetV2
- ResNet50

##  Tools & Tech
- Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OprnCV
- Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook
- Django + ReactJS for frontend & backend

##  Results
ResNet50 achieved 96% accuracy in classifying disease severity levels and scoring. 
YOLOv8 provided fast real-time detection with almost 98% accuracy.
InceptionResNetV2 balanced performance and precision.

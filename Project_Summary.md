#  Project Summary

##  Problem Statement
Farmers in rural Pakistan face severe wheat losses due to late diagnosis of Rust and Smut diseases. Manual inspections are slow and error-prone.

##  Objectives
- Study Wheat Diseases, Specifically Rust and Smut.
- Collect Wheat Plant Data.
- Detect Rust and Smut from wheat leaf images using CNN models.
- Development of Disease Detection Machine Learning Module.
- Provide early warnings to farmers by User-Friendly Interface.

##  Dataset
- 10,000+ images collected manually from 6 farms in Sindh.
- Data includes healthy, diseased (Rust, Smut), and scoring.

##  Models Used
- YOLOv8 (Finalized)
- InceptionResNetV2
- ResNet50

##  Tools & Tech
- Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OprnCV
- Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook
- Django + ReactJS for frontend & backend

##  Results
ResNet50 achieved 96% accuracy in classifying disease severity levels and scoring. 
YOLOv8 provided fast real-time detection with almost 98% accuracy.
InceptionResNetV2 balanced performance and precision.

##  SDG Goals
- Zero Hunger
- Decent Work & Economic Growth
- Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure
